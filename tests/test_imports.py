"""Smoke tests for module imports.

Catches the class of bug fixed by the absolute-import switch
(monorepo legacy `from adapters import …` worked when something on
sys.path had an `adapters/` package; modular template repos that ship
only `/app/adapter.py` broke). Any future regression to relative-style
top-level imports gets caught here before publish.

These tests run in a clean Python environment with NO `adapters/`
package on sys.path — exactly the deployment shape consumers see.
